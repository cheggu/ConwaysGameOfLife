# ConwaysGameOfLife

 Visualized and Interactable Conway's Game of Life Simulator

My goal is to visualize Conway's Game of Life, and allow the user to build custom "lifeforms".

Here's what it looks like right now:

Will work on UI/UX in the future, as well as customizable speed. 
The current simulation currently updates every 100ms, but it can go much quicker than that.

This was accomplished using C++ and <a href=https://www.sfml-dev.org/>SFML</a>

Expect poor coding practices. Don't hate pls.
